This DCL archive contains all the required bits and pieces for preparing
pictures for plotting by TeX. When executed, the archive creates
the following files:

   o BLURB.TXT     this file
   o HALFTONE.TEX  user-level documentation (for LaTeX)
   o PICTURE.TEX   picture from TeXPIC used by HALFTONE.TEX
   o TEXPIC.FOR    the software. Note that there are two versions
                   of TEXPIC in this file, one for VMS and another
                   which is a little more portable.
   o HALFTONE.MF   Don Knuth's halftone font

If you intend to produce pictures of size >= 256 x 256, you'll need to
expand TeX's memory (see my article in TUGboat vol 8 no 3 for more
details). I can supply a TeX change file for VAX/VMS which effects this
change (and provides an editor interface) either by e-MAIL or on tape.
Contact me for more details. 

If you want to use this software, but you're not a TeX guru...find
someone who is!  He/she will be able to generate convert the Metafont
source for the halftone font (HALFTONE.MF) to a form acceptible to
TeX, and put it in the right directories for you to use.  I can supply
outline help, but the font generation process tends to be horribly
site-dependent.  Sorry.

If you have any trouble with the software, please let me know (it's not
quite the same as the version I use myself). I'm particularly keen
to receive feedback from non-VMS sites.
