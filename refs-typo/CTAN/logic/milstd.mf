%       "milstd" font by Rick Simpson
%       (published in UKTeX 1988, issue 30 (23 Sept. 1988))

%       Contains a collection of special characters for
%       use in logic diagrams


%       To create the "milstd" font, use command:
%               makefont milstd

%       To use the characters in a PLAIN TeX document:
%               \font\milstd=milstd         % define the font
%               . . .
%               {\milstd\char0}             % typeset the character

%       To use the characters in a LaTeX document:
%               \newfont{\milstd}{milstd}   % define the font
%               . . .
%               {\milstd\char0}             % typeset the character

%       See "milstd.tex" for definitions to be used with TeX and LaTeX
