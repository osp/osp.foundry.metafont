These fonts provide three script fonts. A `cursive' shape, which is a
slanted shape written with a wide-nibbed pen. A `twist' shape: a slanted
shape with constant width. And a `modern script' shape: an upright shape
with a forward sloping stress axis.  They would mainly be suitable for
display text.

See the readme file in the kraml directory for details of the fonts. 
In this directory there are support files:
	ot1vc.fd		A font definition file
	vicent.sty		A package to help use of these fonts
	testvic.{tex,ps}	An example file.
Comments about these files should be directed to James Kilfiger
<mapdn@csv.warwick.ac.uk>

Installation:
The ot1vc.fd and vicent.sty should be put somewhere where TeX can find
them.  On a TDS distribution, such as teTeX or MiKTeX, an appropriate
place might be .../texmf/tex/latex/mfnfss/ . Willibald Kraml's .mf files
should be placed where metafont can find them.  For example in
.../texmf/fonts/source/public/vc/ . You will probably now need to
refresh your texmf database, by issuing the command `texhash' on teTeX
or from the MikTeX menu in the start menu. You may need to run metafont
by hand, but this is not necessary on modern TeX distributions.

Use:
The fonts may be used with both plain TeX and LaTeX. Plain users should
load the fonts with the \font primitive command. LaTeX users should
give the command \usepackage{vicent} in the preamble of their document. 
This package provides three font changing declarations: \cursiveshape,
\twistshape, and \modernscriptshape; and corresponding text font
commands: \textcursive, etc.  

Note for Latex hackers:  
This family can be chosen with \fontfamily{vc}, then the cursive shape
with \fontshape{it}, the modern script shape by \fontshape{sl} and the
twist shape by \fontshape{ui}. 

The fonts also provide lowercase swash characters, these can only be
selected by \fontshape commands, with shapes `its', `uis', and `sls'.
